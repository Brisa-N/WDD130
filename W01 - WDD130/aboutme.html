    <h2>Brisa Noriega</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name Brisa and I am very excited for this course!</p>
    <p>My husband and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada although we were both born outside of the country (I am from Nicaragua).
        Not a huge fan of the desert heat here, but I love living near family.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy staying busy by going to the gym or trying different hobbies. I really enjoy going on new adventures!
        I am also very excited to see what BYU-I has in store for me. I am a bit nervous diving in to new and difficult topics, 
        but I am confident I will do my very best to be successful. I enjoy tech and learning different topics from this industry
        so I can't wait to learn!
    </p>
    <p>I am a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I was baptized over 10 years ago when I was much younger, 
        but it was one of the best decisions I have made. One of my favorite leaders, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said in a April 2016 
        conference talk:
    </p>
    <p>"Our Savior, the Good Shepherd, knows and loves us. He knows and love you. He knows when you are lost, and He knows where you are. 
        He knows your grief. Your silent pleadings. Your fears. Your tears. It matters not how you became lost -- whether because of your own 
        poor choices or because of circumstances beyond your control. What matters is that you are His child. And He loves you. He loves His 
        children. Because He loves you, He will find you. He will place you upon His shoulders, rejoicing. And when He brings you home, He will
        say to one and all, 'Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.'"
    </p>
    <p>What power behind those words!</p>
